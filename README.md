## üéØ Overview

This project demonstrates a sophisticated cloud-based recipe generation application that leverages **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to create personalized recipe suggestions. The system combines the power of vector databases with large language models (LLMs) to deliver contextually relevant and creative recipe recommendations based on user input.

### Key Highlights
- ‚úÖ **Scalable Architecture**: Auto-scaling groups ensure high availability
- ‚úÖ **AI-Powered**: Advanced NLP models for recipe generation
- ‚úÖ **Secure Design**: VPC isolation with public/private subnet architecture
- ‚úÖ **Cost-Optimized**: Strategic use of free-tier resources
- ‚úÖ **Production-Ready**: Load balancers and monitoring included

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The application follows a multi-tier architecture designed for security, scalability, and performance:

![Architecture Diagram](Recipe_Architecture-final.drawio.png)

### Network Architecture
- **VPC**: Isolated virtual network with enhanced security
- **Multi-AZ Deployment**: 2 public and 2 private subnets across different Availability Zones
- **Load Balancing**: Separate ALBs for frontend and backend traffic management

### Compute Layer
- **Frontend**: Nginx servers (`t2.micro`) in public subnets
- **Backend**: Flask application servers (`t2.micro`) in private subnets
- **Auto Scaling**: Dynamic scaling based on demand

## ‚ú® Key Features

- ü§ñ **AI-Powered Recipe Generation** using state-of-the-art language models
- üîç **Vector-Based Recipe Search** with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- üìä **Real-time Analytics** and monitoring with CloudWatch
- üîí **Enterprise-Grade Security** with VPC and IAM roles
- ‚ö° **High Performance** with optimized caching and load balancing
- üì± **RESTful API** for easy integration and scalability

## üõ†Ô∏è AWS Services Used

| Service | Purpose | Configuration |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| **EC2** | Application hosting | `t2.micro` instances with Auto Scaling |
| **VPC** | Network isolation | 2 public + 2 private subnets across 2 AZs |
| **Application Load Balancer** | Traffic distribution | Frontend & Backend ALBs |
| **Auto Scaling Groups** | Dynamic scaling | Automatic instance management |
| **Amazon OpenSearch** | Vector database | Recipe index with KNN search |
| **SageMaker** | ML model hosting | 2 endpoints for embedding & generation |
| **S3** | Object storage | Snapshots and assets with encryption |
| **CloudWatch** | Monitoring & logging | Metrics and alerts |
| **IAM** | Access management | Role-based security |

### SageMaker Endpoints

1. **Text Embedding Model**
   - Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
   - Instance: `ml.t2.medium`
   - Purpose: Convert user input to 384-dimensional vectors

2. **Recipe Generation Model**
   - Model: `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6`
   - Instance: `ml.m5.xlarge`
   - Purpose: Generate creative recipes from prompts

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

The application follows a streamlined data flow for recipe generation:

### Detailed Process Flow

1. **User Input**: User sends HTTPS request with recipe query to Frontend ALB
2. **Request Routing**: ALB routes request to available Backend EC2 instance
3. **Text Embedding**: Backend sends user text to `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` SageMaker endpoint
4. **Vector Search**: 384-dimensional vector used to query OpenSearch recipe index
5. **Context Retrieval**: Top 5 most similar recipes retrieved using KNN search
6. **Recipe Generation**: Backend constructs detailed prompt and sends to `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-6-6`
7. **Response Delivery**: Generated recipe with relevance scores returned as JSON

## üîí Security & Optimization

### Security Measures
- **VPC Isolation**: All critical resources isolated within private subnets
- **IAM Roles**: Least-privilege access with role-based permissions
- **Encryption**: S3 server-side encryption for data at rest
- **Network Security**: Security groups and NACLs for traffic control
- **Private Resources**: OpenSearch domain accessible only by backend EC2 role

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- **Free Tier Usage**: Maximized use of AWS free tier resources
- **Instance Right-sizing**: `t2.micro` instances for appropriate workloads
- **Resource Management**: Automated SageMaker endpoint lifecycle management
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch alerts to prevent cost overruns

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

| Resource | Instance Type | Estimated Monthly Cost |
|----------|---------------|----------------------|
| EC2 Instances | t2.micro (4x) | $0.00 (Free Tier) |
| Application Load Balancers | Standard (2x) | $32.40 |
| SageMaker Endpoints | ml.t2.medium + ml.m5.xlarge | $45.60 |
| OpenSearch Domain | t3.small.search | $24.48 |
| S3 Storage | Standard | $2.30 |
| CloudWatch | Standard | $10.00 |
| Data Transfer | Various | $12.02 |
| **Total Estimated Cost** | | **~$126.80/month** |

*Note: Costs based on us-east-1 region pricing and include optimization strategies*
